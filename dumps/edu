According to the harmonised classification and labelling (ATP06) approved by the European Union, this substance is toxic if inhaled, causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure, is very toxic to aquatic life, is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects, is harmful if swallowed, causes serious eye damage and may cause an allergic skin reaction. This substance is approved for use as a biocide in the EEA and/or Switzerland, for: product preservation, wood preservation, preservation for working / cutting fluids. It is being reviewed for use as a biocide in the EEA and/or Switzerland, for: preservation films, preservation of fibres, leather, rubber, or polymers, preservation for construction materials. Notwithstanding the absence of firm evidence for IPBC being dehalogenated to produce free iodine in animals or in humans, the patch test reactions to IPBC in iodine-allergic subjects were possibly caused by free iodine released from this preservative agent, thus underlining the EU restrictions regarding the use of this preservative in cosmetics.,;European Commission Legislation (Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 y 2019/831, Annexes I to VI and all the amendments to the cosmetics regulation).; Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products Evaluation of active substancesAssessment Report (January 2015, Denmark); European Chemical Agency (ECHA);,NaN,European Commission Legislation (Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 y 2019/831, Annexes I to VI and all the amendments to the cosmetics regulation).,-,-,Suspected carcinogen,IPBC is not toxic to reproduction or a developmental toxicant. In experimental animal studies IPBC did not affect fertility and did not cause developmental toxicity. The evidence suggests that this substance does not possess significant potential with respect to toxicity to reproduction.,Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products Evaluation of active substancesAssessment Report (January 2015, Denmark); European Chemical Agency (ECHA),PBC and PBC are not included in the EU list of potential endocrine disruptors (COM DG ENV, 2000). IPBC and PBC have not been found on the Endocrine disruptor website of the European Commission: Annex 13 (List of 146 substances with endocrine disruption categorizations prepared in the Expert meeting) and 15 (List of 66 Category 1 substances with categorisation high, medium or low exposure concern). IPBC and PBC are not covered by the interim criteria described in Article 5.3 in BPR. Conclusion is that neither IPBC nor PBC has endocrine disruptor properties.,European Commission Legislation (Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 y 2019/831, Annexes I to VI and all the amendments to the cosmetics regulation).,Suspected skin sensitiser. IPBC is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral route and of low toxicity by the dermal route. IPBC is classified toxic by inhalation. The substance is not irritating to skin but is a severe eye irritant and a skin sensitizer.,We suspect that, notwithstanding the absence of firm evidence for IPBC being dehalogenated to produce free iodine in animals or in humans, the patch test reactions to IPBC in iodine-allergic subjects were possibly caused by free iodine released from this preservative agent, thus underlining the EU restrictions regarding the use of this preservative in cosmetics.
